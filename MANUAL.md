## Concept

Each agent runs in **its own git worktree** (a checkout of a fresh `agent/<task>`
branch under `.agents/`) inside **its own tmux session**, on a **dedicated tmux
server** (`tmux -L wta`) so it never mixes with your own `tmux ls`. The agent is
any CLI you like (`claude` by default). wta is the harness around it — it doesn't
store your conversation (Claude Code does, per directory).

---

## Creating agents

```sh
wta new fix-auth                       # worktree + agent/fix-auth branch + agent, from HEAD
wta new fix-auth --base develop        # base the branch on an existing branch
wta new fix-auth -- "add a login test" # everything after -- is passed to the agent (an initial prompt for claude)
```

Task names must be letters/digits/`-`/`_` (≤64 chars). From the dashboard press
`n` (blank agent), `N` (agent + initial prompt), or `b` (pick an existing branch
to base on, with type-to-filter).

**Fan-out** — try one prompt N ways, keep the best:

```sh
wta fanout refactor -n 3 -- "refactor the auth module, keep behavior identical"
# creates refactor-1, refactor-2, refactor-3
wta matrix                # see which of them conflict with each other / main
# review each in `wta dash`, then:
wta push refactor-2 --pr  # keep the winner
wta rm refactor-1 --force # drop the rest
wta rm refactor-3 --force
```

---

## The dashboard

```sh
wta dash
```

Left: the **Instances** sidebar (index, task, branch, `+adds/-dels`, status).
Right: **Preview** (live, full-color capture of the agent's pane) and **Diff**
(colorized diff vs the base branch, including untracked files) — `Tab` switches.

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `j` / `k` | move selection |
| `Enter` / `o` | attach into the agent (exited/merged → resume) |
| `Tab` | switch Preview / Diff |
| `Shift+↑` / `↓` | scroll; first `Shift+↑` enters scroll mode over full scrollback, `Esc` exits |
| `i` | send one line without attaching (only when `●` ready) |
| `v` | run `.wta/verify.sh` checks for the selected agent |
| `e` | open the worktree in your editor |
| `m` | mergeability matrix overlay |
| `n` / `N` | new agent / new agent with an initial prompt |
| `b` | new agent based on an existing branch |
| `s` | stop (keep the worktree, resume later) |
| `D` | kill (destroy worktree + branch; confirms, and warns on unpushed commits) |
| `p` | commit + push + open a PR |
| `J` / `K` | reorder the list (persisted) |
| `r` | refresh · `?` help · `q` quit |

**Status glyphs:** `⠋` running · `●` ready · `▲` needs input · `◆` review
(finished, unseen) · `✓` merged (landed in base) · `✗` exited. A verify check adds
`⟳`/`✓`/`✗` to the left of the status.

---

## Attaching & sending input

- **Attach** — `Enter`/`o` (or `wta attach <task>`) drops you into the agent's
  real terminal. Type normally. **`Ctrl-q` detaches** back to wta (not tmux's
  `Ctrl-b d`).
- **Quick-send** — press `i`, type one line, `Enter`. It's injected into the
  agent without attaching. Gated to when the agent is `●` ready and idle, so you
  never inject mid-stream.

---

## Reviewing & merging

- **Diff tab** — colorized diff vs the base branch, with `+adds/-dels` counts;
  agent-created (untracked) files are included.
- **Mergeability matrix** — `m` in the dash or `wta matrix`. A pairwise grid of
  which agent branches merge cleanly with each other **and** the base, via
  `git merge-tree` (read-only — nothing is committed or checked out). Agents
  failing their verify checks are shown in red.
- **Push / PR** — `p` in the dash or `wta push <task> [--pr]`. Commits any
  uncommitted work (excluding injected context files), pushes `agent/<task>`, and
  with `--pr` opens a PR via `gh`.

---

## Verification gate

Drop an executable `.wta/verify.sh` in the repo (or run `wta init`). Make it exit
non-zero on failure:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -e
cargo test      # or: npm test / pytest -q / make check
```

wta runs it for each agent **when it finishes** (and on demand with `v`),
**asynchronously** so a slow suite never blocks the UI. Results show as `⟳`/`✓`/`✗`
in the sidebar; failing agents are **grayed red in the matrix**, so you don't
merge on "the agent said it's done." A failing check surfaces its last line in the
message bar. (Auto-retry-on-red is intentionally not enabled.)

---

## Cross-agent review

Agents can't reliably grade themselves, so spawn an independent reviewer on the
builder's branch:

```sh
wta review fix-auth                         # spawns review-fix-auth on fix-auth's branch
wta review fix-auth --by "claude --model haiku"   # use a cheaper/different model
```

The reviewer gets a prompt to inspect the diff vs base, run the tests, and end
with `REVIEW: PASS` or `REVIEW: FAIL`. Watch it in `wta dash` like any agent.
Default reviewer CLI: `WTA_REVIEW_AGENT_CMD`, else `WTA_AGENT_CMD`.

---

## Open in your editor

```sh
wta open fix-auth       # or press `e` in the dash
```

Opens the selected agent's worktree in `WTA_OPEN_CMD` (falls back to `$EDITOR`):

- **GUI editors** (`code`, `cursor`, `zed`, JetBrains…) launch **detached** — wta
  stays on the dashboard.
- **Terminal editors** (`nvim`/LazyVim, `vim`, `helix`, `emacs -nw`…) open
  **inline** — wta suspends, you edit in the worktree, and `:q` returns you to the
  dashboard.

Force either behavior with `WTA_OPEN_INLINE=1` (inline) or `0` (detached).

---

## Notifications

When an agent **you're not looking at** finishes or needs input, wta:

- plays a **system sound** (`afplay` on macOS, `paplay` on Linux) — because the
  terminal bell is muted in many terminals,
- marks the agent `◆` (review / unseen),
- shows a **"N need you"** count in the menu bar.

Selecting/opening the agent clears it. Silence with `WTA_NOTIFY_SOUND=0`, or set it
to a sound-file path for your own alert.

"Needs input" detection is best with the optional Claude Code hooks:

```sh
wta install-hooks            # this repo (writes .claude/settings.json)
wta install-hooks --global   # all repos (~/.claude/settings.json)
```

Hooks are appended, never clobbered. Without them you still get running / ready /
exited automatically.

---

## Agent lifecycle

```sh
wta stop fix-auth      # kill the tmux session, KEEP the worktree (resumable)
wta resume fix-auth    # re-spawn the session in the existing worktree (claude --continue)
wta rm fix-auth        # destroy: session + worktree + branch
wta rm fix-auth --force # also discard uncommitted work / an unmerged branch
```

- **Persistence** — sessions survive closing the terminal and laptop sleep. A
  reboot ends them, but the worktrees remain; `Enter` (or `resume`) re-spawns and
  `--continue`s the previous conversation.
- **Kill safety** — `D` in the dash confirms, and if there's committed-but-unpushed
  work it warns before discarding. On a dirty worktree it asks a second time.
- **Merged** — once an agent's branch has landed in the base branch it shows `✓
  merged`, so you know it's safe to `rm`.

---

## Per-repo setup

```sh
wta init    # scaffold .wta/{verify.sh, setup.sh, teardown.sh} (idempotent)
```

- **`.wta/setup.sh`** runs in each fresh worktree on `wta new` — install deps,
  symlink `node_modules`, copy fixtures, etc.
- **`.wta/teardown.sh`** runs on `wta rm`, before the worktree is removed — stop
  containers, free ports.
- **Context files** — `WTA_CONTEXT_FILES` (default `CLAUDE.local.md .env
  .env.local .mcp.json`) are copied into every worktree at creation and are kept
  out of `push` commits so secrets don't land in a PR.
- **Isolation slots** — each agent gets a stable `WTA_INDEX` (a distinct 0–99
  slot) and `WTA_PORT_BASE` (a unique 10-port block) in its pane **and** in
  `setup.sh`. Use them so parallel dev servers / DBs don't collide:
  ```sh
  # in .wta/setup.sh
  echo "PORT=$WTA_PORT_BASE" >> .env.local
  createdb "myapp_$WTA_INDEX" 2>/dev/null || true
  ```
- **Run-log** — when a `.wta/` dir exists, wta appends `stop`/`rm`/`push` events to
  `.wta/run-log.md`.

Add `.agents/` (and `.wta/run-log.md` if you like) to `.gitignore`.

---

## Multiple repos

Sessions and state are namespaced per repo, so the **same task name in two repos
never collides**. `wta dash` shows only the current repo's agents. Just `cd` to a
repo and run wta there.

---

## Remote control (Telegram)

Build with the feature, set your bot token + chat id, and run the bridge:

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/zakrad/wta --features telegram
export WTA_TELEGRAM_TOKEN=…  WTA_TELEGRAM_CHAT=…
wta bridge          # test config first with: wta bridge --test
```

It pings you when an agent needs input / finishes, and you can drive agents back:

- `/agents` — list agents
- `/use <task>` then just type — send to the picked agent
- `/send <task> <text>` — send to a specific agent

Needs the Claude Code hooks (above) for "needs input" pings.

---

## Using a different agent CLI

wta is agent-agnostic — point `WTA_AGENT_CMD` at any interactive CLI:

```sh
WTA_AGENT_CMD=codex wta new thing
WTA_AGENT_CMD="claude --model haiku" wta new thing     # multi-word is fine
WTA_AGENT_CMD=aider wta new thing
WTA_AGENT_CMD=bash  wta new scratch                    # kick the tyres, no tokens
```

`--continue`-style resume is Claude's default; set `WTA_AGENT_RESUME_ARGS` for
another CLI (or empty to just relaunch it).

---

| `WTA_NOTIFY_SOUND` | `1` | notification sound (`0` = silent, or a sound-file path) |
| `WTA_TMUX_SOCKET` | `wta` | tmux server socket (`default` = your own tmux; same as `--server`) |
| `WTA_TELEGRAM_TOKEN` / `WTA_TELEGRAM_CHAT` | — | Telegram bridge bot token + chat id |

Exported **to** each agent (read them in `setup.sh` / your agent): `WTA_TASK`,
`WTA_REPO`, `WTA_INDEX`, `WTA_PORT_BASE`, `WTA_ROOT` (setup/teardown only).
